# SEO Principles

This project reframed SEO from a traffic-acquisition tactic into a **content intelligence system**.

The goal was not simply to rank but to ensure SCARPA products could be:
- Correctly understood
- Accurately summarized
- Confidently recommended

By both humans and machines.

---

## 1️⃣ Intent Is the Primary Optimization Unit

Keywords were treated as *signals*, not objectives.

Primary optimization targets included:
- Pre-purchase research questions
- Comparison and differentiation moments
- Fit, sizing, and performance clarity
- Category-level decision logic

This aligned PDP content with how real customers—and AI systems—evaluate products.

---

## 2️⃣ Write for Extraction, Not Just Persuasion

AI systems do not “read” holistically.  
They extract.

Content was designed so that:
- Key facts stand alone
- Sentences remain meaningful out of context
- Benefits are explicit, not implied
- Technical details are explained, not assumed

This ensures summaries remain accurate even when detached from the page.

---

## 3️⃣ Explicit Feature → Benefit → Use Case Mapping

Each product description intentionally connects:

- **What the product has**
- **Why that matters**
- **Who it is for**

This structure supports:
- AI summarization
- Sales enablement
- Customer confidence
- Reduced return risk

---

## 4️⃣ Separate Content by System, Not Length

Different systems consume content differently.

Rather than trimming or reusing copy arbitrarily, each description type was purpose-built:

| Content Type | Optimized For |
|------------|---------------|
| PDP Copy | Evaluation & AI summaries |
| Short Description | Discovery & scanning |
| Meta Description | Search & citation |
| Workbook Copy | Internal enablement |

This avoided dilution and misuse across channels.

---

## 5️⃣ Consistency Is a Ranking Signal (Even When Rankings Fade)

AI systems infer trust through consistency.

This required:
- Standardized terminology
- Repeated phrasing patterns
- Aligned category language
- Controlled variation

Governance mattered as much as copy quality.

---

## 6️⃣ SEO Must Be Maintainable to Be Valuable

Any optimization that:
- Requires heroics
- Depends on one person
- Breaks under scale

…is a liability.

This project prioritized **repeatability**, **reviewability**, and **long-term ownership** over short-term gains.
