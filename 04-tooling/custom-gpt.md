# Custom GPT Model

This project included the development of a custom GPT model designed to accelerate SEO content production while preserving SCARPA’s brand integrity, technical accuracy, and AI-search readiness.

The model was not treated as a generic copy generator, but as a **constrained system** operating within clearly defined rules.

---

## 🎯 Model Purpose

The GPT model acted as a **product copywriting and SEO specialist** for SCARPA North America.

Its role was to:
- Draft AI- and search-optimized product descriptions
- Express SCARPA’s brand platform and mountain heritage
- Maintain technical credibility across complex product categories
- Produce structured outputs ready for human review and production

---

## 📦 Structured Output Requirements

Each product required four distinct outputs, each optimized for a different system:

- **Benefit Blurb** (primary PDP copy)
- **Short Description** (collection & discovery UX)
- **Meta Description** (search & AI summaries)
- **Workbook Copy** (internal & wholesale enablement)

This prevented content from being reused outside its intended context.

## 🧠 Prompt Architecture (High-Level)

The production prompt encoded rules across four domains:

### 1️⃣ Brand & Voice Constraints
- Authentic, experience-driven tone
- Confident but not boastful
- Grounded in real-world use, terrain, and motion
- “No place is too far” as an underlying narrative, not a slogan

### 2️⃣ SEO & AI-Search Constraints
- Intent-first opening sentences
- Explicit feature → benefit → use case mapping
- Natural language optimized for AI summaries and voice queries
- Avoidance of keyword stuffing and brand overuse
- Support for E-E-A-T principles

### 3️⃣ Structural Constraints
- Consistent formatting for AI extractability
- Clear paragraphing and bullet usage
- Measurable specs included where available
- Content designed to stand alone when summarized out of context

### 4️⃣ Safety & Accuracy Rules
- No invented features
- Responsible inference only when explicitly allowed
- Preference for asking clarifying questions over guessing
- Alignment with compliance and sustainability requirements

---

## 🧍 Persona Awareness

The model was instructed to recognize multiple user personas (e.g., professional athletes, enthusiasts, committed users, and new explorers) and adjust tone and emphasis accordingly, while maintaining a consistent brand voice.

---

## 🔁 Human-in-the-Loop Design

AI output was never published directly.

The model was designed to:
- Generate first-pass drafts
- Accelerate iteration
- Reduce cognitive load on reviewers

Final approval always remained human-driven.

## 🎯 Why This Matters

By encoding brand, SEO, and governance rules directly into the model, SCARPA was able to:

- Increase content throughput without sacrificing quality
- Maintain consistency across 130+ PDPs
- Produce content better suited for AI-mediated discovery
- Create a repeatable system for future product launches
