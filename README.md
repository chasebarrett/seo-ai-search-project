**Case Study | SEO Strategy | AI-Ready Content Systems**

This repository documents a large-scale SEO transformation project executed at SCARPA North America, focused on future-proofing product content for **AI-driven search** while improving clarity, governance, and cross-team execution.

- Internal teams (Marketing, Sales, Product, Leadership)

---

## 🎯 Outcomes

- Improved AI readability across **134 product pages**
- Reduced reliance on paid media through stronger native search performance
- Established repeatable content standards for current and future products

## 🧪 Why AI-Search Changed the Approach

Traditional SEO optimizes for rankings.  
AI-search optimizes for **answers, intent, and citation**.

This project anticipated:

- Brand content being summarized—not clicked
- Increased importance of clarity, structure, and trust signals
